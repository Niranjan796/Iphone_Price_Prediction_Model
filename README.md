# Iphone_Price_Prediction_Model_using_Linear_Regression (Mini-Project)

* This is a simple machine learning project that builds a Linear Regression model to predict iPhone prices based on a single feature. The dataset contains only 11 data points with two columns: feature and target price.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Iphone_Prices.csv
A minimal dataset with:

* feature (version)

* price (actual price of the iPhone)

ðŸ”§ Project Overview : 
* Explored the relationship between a single feature and iPhone price.

* Built a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.

* Visualized regression-line  version vs price


ðŸ’» Technologies Used :

* Python

* Jupyter Notebook

* Pandas, Matplotlib

* Scikit-learn (LinearRegression)
  

ðŸš€ How to Run : 
* Clone the repo

* Open Iphone_Price_prediction_model.ipynb

* Run all cells to:

* Load the dataset

* Visualize the data

* Train the regression model

* Predict prices and evaluate accuracy
  

ðŸ§  Educational Value : 
* This project is perfect for:

* Beginners learning supervised ML

* Hands-on practice with regression

* Quick demonstration of predictive modeling using real-world data
